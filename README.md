# Auditory Experiments

#### Example experiments built on AuditoryStimuli.jl

## Instructions

Each experiment is contained in a directory. Each experiment contains a Project.toml file to allow precise reproduction of the experimental setup and behaviour.

Each experiment will output results as a csv file in the directory it is run. And may also output a log file or summary result.

Experiments use a basic terminal graphical interface to guide the participant.
